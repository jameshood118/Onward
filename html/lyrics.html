							I’m feeling good, I’m feeling fine<BR>
							Living my life for Him, straight down the line<BR>
							I never thought I could get myself out of the mess I was in<BR>
							The hole I dug was as deep as one could ever possibly imagine<BR>
							The selfish side of my ego was never ever in doubt<BR>
							Until I finally realized that this is not what life is about<BR>
							I finally got a clue<BR>
							I’m feeling good, I’m feeling fine<BR>
							Living my life for Him, straight down the line<BR>
							The world without Him was all I knew, I heard but He never seemed real<BR>
							This silly fellow who spent His life living for others so they may heal<BR>
							The afterlife was a fantasy, a joke that could never be true<BR>
							And then I suddenly changed my mind and now I sing a different tune<BR>
							And it goes like this.<BR>
							I’m feeling good, I’m feeling fine<BR>
							Living my life for Him, straight down the line<BR>
							(solo)<BR>
							And though I’ll never be perfect I can say that I’ll always be there<BR>
							I live for Him ‘cause He died for me, I hope the message hits you quite clear<BR>
							Life on earth is a gift from Him, Go out and live it like He would wish<BR>
							If all you ever do with your time is practice what He preaches - go fish<BR>
							I hope you catch something!<BR>
							I’m feeling good, I’m feeling fine<BR>
							Living my life for Him, straight down the line<BR>
							I’m feeling good, I’m feeling fine<BR>
							Living my life for Him, straight down the<BR>
							straight down the<BR>
							straight down the line!<BR>
