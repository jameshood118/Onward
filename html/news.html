<b>November</b><BR>
With the change in season, changes have come to the band.<BR>

<li>Aaron Cox has decided to leave Onward for the band at his 'home' church, Living Word Church, on Garth Road.  We have enjoyed Aaron's time with the band and wish him the best.
<BR>
<li>Jennifer Hood has also decided to leave Onward; she and James want to attend a church closer to home.  We also wish them the best in their new role as parents; the rewards will be enormous!

Onward is hard at work on the set list for the Big Spring Jam performance. The plan is to play a mix of songs from "Walkin' On Water," popular positive-message cover songs, and a few new original songs that have debuted over the past few months. The band also expects to have someone at the site selling "Walkin' On Water" CDs, so this is an opportunity to get a copy if you haven't already done so.<BR><BR>
