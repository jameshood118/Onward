When the music fades - All is stripped away<BR>
And I simply come<BR>
Longing just to bring - Something that's of worth<BR>
That will bless your heart.<BR>
<BR>
I'll bring You more than a song<BR>
For a song in itself - Is not what You have required<BR>
You search much deeper within<BR>
Through the way things appear - You're looking into my heart<BR>
<BR>
I'm coming back to the heart of worhip<BR>
And it's all about You - It's all about You, Jesus<BR>
I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it<BR>
When it's all about You - It's all about You, Jesus<BR>
<BR>
King of endless worth - No one could express<BR>
How much you deserve<BR>
Though I'm weak and poor - All I have is yours<BR>
Every single breath<BR>

For a song in itself - Is not what You have required<BR>
